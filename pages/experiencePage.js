Implemented back-end features for a truck identification system on Node.js using event-driven, model-driven, and micro-services architecture. Boosted the mean average precision of the object detection model from 98.3% to 99.5% by balancing the dataset using augmentation techniques. Implemented and deployed a hierarchical tracking algorithm to handle mislabeled object detections by persisting relevant information.'

For this, I automated customer segmentation for applicants who declined offers by implementing a KModes model, ensuring our outreach efforts were more targeted and effective. Additionally, I developed a user-friendly GUI that could be customized to cater to the unique needs of each program. On the enrollment front, I ideated and programmed a seamless data import pipeline using the Destiny API in Python, streamlining the student enrollment process. To gauge the effectiveness of our campaigns, I automated the generation of performance reports on LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook using their respective APIs. Furthermore, I took charge of creating, organizing, and optimizing dashboards on Tableau Server, enabling our team to monitor key metrics effortlessly, and I handled custom student data analytics requests efficiently. My work also involved using Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Classifier models to identify the factors contributing to accepted, denied, or declined applications, helping us refine our admissions strategies.',
